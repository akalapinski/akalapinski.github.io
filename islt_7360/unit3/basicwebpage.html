<p>It's time to start thinking about project topics for 
our final websites! Some topic choices I'm considering are:</p> 

<h2><i>Topic 1</i></h2>
<h3><u>Happy Tails</u></h3>

<p>I love to take my pup to area dog parks, 
dog swims, and other pet-friendly venues! <br><i>However, 
finding such places isn't alwasy easy.</i><br> I'd like to 
create a website that allows users to find dog-freindly 
events, parks, stores (and more) within the 
Saint Louis, Missouri area. </p>

<p>I was thinking about including such things as:</p>

<ul>
<li>Upcoming Events such as the 
<a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/apas-canine-carnival-tickets-26064838634">
APA's Canine Carnival</a></li>
<li>Area Dog Parks, such as 
<a href="http://www.stcharlesparks.com/facilities/dusable-dog-park/">
Dusable Dog Park</a></li>
<li>Pet-Centered Shops, such as 
<a href="http://www.treats-unleashed.com/">Treats Unleashed</a></li>
<li>And More!</li>
</ul>

<h2><i>Topic 2</i></h2>
<h3><u>The Sweet Spot</u></h3>

<p>I'm also an avid baker! My sister and I love to get 
together and bake. Our particular favorite is cookies. 
I was considering a website with <br>recipes for different 
cookies and such. I'd like to have them divided up, 
with different pages for chocolate lovers, 
cinnamon addicts and the like. <br>Marian Keyes says it best:</p>

<blockquote cite="https://afternoontea4two.wordpress.com/2016/04/20/marian-keyes-on-baking/">
Baking makes me focus. On weighing the sugar. On sieving the flour. 
I find it calming and rewarding because, in fairness, <br>it is sort 
of magic - you start off with all this disparate stuff, such as 
butter and eggs, and what you end up with is so totally different. 
<br>And also delicious.</blockquote>
