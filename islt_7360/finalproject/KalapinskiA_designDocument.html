<h2>Purpose:</h2>

<p>This website will be for Dog Lovers. 
Happy Tails is a reference website for dog lovers to peruse 
to locate pet-centered shops, area dog parks, and upcoming events, 
all within the St. Louis area. There are a few websites that center 
around one of these things, however, I haven't found a site that exposes
its user to all of this information, all in one convenient spot. Fellow
dog lovers will be able to use the website to learn about dog-centered 
activities, and perhaps provide additional events or information!
</p>

<h2>Audience:</h2>

<p>The website is geared toward dog lovers residing within St. Louis
and the surrounding area. I've had to check three or more websites to find 
area dog parks, upcoming events, pet-centered shops, etc. to share with my 
pup. Dog lovers will benefit from this website by having all the information
in one convenient spot!</p>

<h2>Needs Assessment:</h2>

<p>I asked five dog lovers residing within the St. Louis area to provide 
me with information about what they would find most helpful on a website. 
They want to see a calendar of events, pictures of pups, and links to 
websites.</p>

<h3>Questions asked:</h3>
<h4>How would this benefit you and your pup?</h4>

<ul>
<li>Could see all of the events right in front of you</li>
<li>Know where to go for food, treats, etc. with your dog in tow</li>
<li>Find places to let dogs socialize</li>
<li>A one-stop-shop for all doggy-related information in the area</li>
</ul>

<h4>What are you most interested in seeing on this site?</h4>

<ul>
<li>Calendar of events organized chronologically</li>
<li>A picture hub, with all kinds of pictures of dogs</li>
<li>Links to social media pages that are dog-centered</li>
<li>Maps of the area, with dog parks clearly labled</li>
<li>Links to the events page/park page/store website to 
get all the information without additional searches</li>
</ul>

<h4>What are you NOT interested in seeing on this site?</h4>

<ul>
<li>Cat-related things</li>
<li>Anything not dog-related</li>
</ul>

<h2>Presentation Information:</h2>

<p>The website will be hierarchical, because there is a central subject 
(dogs) with supporting pages (events/parks/shops/etc.</p>

<ul>
<li>For consistency across pages, and for ease of use across the site, 
    all pages will contain:
  <ul>
    <li>Same banner atop each page</li>
    <li>A horizontal navigation bar at the top of each page</li>
    <li>Same navigation order on each page</li>
    <li>Contact information at the bottom of each page</li></ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>The HOME page will contain:
  <ul>
    <li>Three column format</li>
    <li>Links to each of the main sections</li>
    <li>A welcome/About statement</li></ul>
</ul>


<ul>
<li>The subsequent pages will contain:
  <ul>
    <li>A side navigation bar that will take the user to the different sections</li>
    <li>The top navigation bar (same on every page)</li></ul>
</ul>



<p>The expected content of each page:</p>

<ul>
<li>The EVENTS page:
  <ul>
    <li>This page will list, chronologically, upcoming dog-centered events</li>
    <li>Divided into three columns, the main content being center</li></ul>
</ul>


<ul>
<li>The SHOPS page:
  <ul>
    <li>Divided into three columns, main content at the center</li>
    <li>List all dog-centerd shops within the area, with hyperlinks to their websites</li></ul>
</ul>


<ul>
<li>The PARKS page:
  <ul>
    <li>Divided into three columns, main content at center</li>
    <li>List all dog parks within the area, with links to their websites</li></ul>
</ul>

<h2>Media:</h2>

<p>The logo will be a personally created logo using a computer program. 
Any other photos displayed on the website will be taken by me. This will 
include a "Feature Pup" photo on the home page, as well as photos of dogs
all over the website. </p>

<h2>Color Scheme and Rationale:</h2>

<p>This website will be centering around dogs and dog-lovers alike. 
With a heavy emphasis on parks and events (which are typically outdoors) 
I believe earthy, natural tones would be most appropriate for the site. 
I chose three blues, a <span style="color: #324851;">blue pine,</span> 
a <span style="color: #34675C;">reflection blue</span>, and a 
<span style="color: #7DA3A1;">blue mist</span>. 
Along with a <span style="color: #86AC41;">grass green</span> tone.
My intention is to use the blue pine as the dark blue as the banner color, 
with mist as the navigation bar color. Additional colors that may be used 
are light gray or light brown. Colors I plan to use are:</p>

<div style="background-color: #324851; text-align: center; color #FFF; line-height: 30px; width: 250px; margin: 15px;">
Blue Pine</div>
<div style="background-color: #34675C; text-align: center; color #FFF; line-height: 30px; width: 250px; margin: 15px;">
Reflection Blue</div>
<div style="background-color: #7DA3A1; text-align: center; color #FFF; line-height: 30px; width: 250px; margin: 15px;">
Blue Mist</div>
<div style="background-color: #86AC41; text-align: center; color #FFF; line-height: 30px; width: 250px; margin: 15px;">
Grass Green</div>
