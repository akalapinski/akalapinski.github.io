<h1>Angelica Kalapinski's Evaluation Report</h1>
<main> 
<h3>Participants</h3>
<p>Jeremy Scott is in his late 20's and very technologically savvy. He has a bit of previous experience with website design. I've known Jeremy for a number of years, and have appreciated his insight and experience when it comes to computer design. He is always helpful when reviewing my work, and I trust him to give constructive feedback to help me improve my work. I asked Jeremy to look specifically at my code and provide feedback. He used his Dell Inspirion running Windows 10, 3rd Generation Intel Core i5-3330 processor, with upto 3.2 GHz and 8GB RAM. He used Google Chrome version 53.0.2785.116 m. His internet connection was Uverse 6.6mbps.   </p>
<p>Courtney Kalapinski is in her mid 20's and has some experience designing web pages using HTML. Throughout our college education we've always assisted eachother by providing feeback on assignments. Courtney has always provided quality feedback that helps me improve my work. I asked her to look at my webpage mainly as a user, and look lightly at my code for any direction/feedback. She used an HP computer running Windows 8, Intel Core i5 with 2.90 GHz, 8.00GB RAM. She used the Internet Explorer 11 Browser, using her workplace wifi network. </p>
<p>Susan Green is my mother, she's in her 60's, and she'd be the first person to tell you she's not very good with electronics. I had her evaluate the look and feel of my website as a novice user. She used her HP Pavilion dm3-1130us laptop. It has a 1.6 GHz processor and 4GB RAM. She has Windows 7, and used Google Chrome (she's unsure of the version). Her internet connection was AT&T Uverse wifi.  </p>

<p>Overall, all users agreed that my overall design is good. There was complaint that the links are sometimes hard to read. Evaluator's suggested the color be darker, or the letters be bolder to increase legibility. User's had no problems accessing the pages, and thought navigation was easy. </p>
<p>User's also believed that the content was pretty good, with a few areas that could use improvement. Suggestions for improvement included adding more content for dog grooming and pet supplies in the "Shops" sections. A few of the links on the "Events" page need to be fixed to ensure my information is accurate and current. Users said my information is clearly labled, with accurate and appropriate links.</p>
<p>The credibility of the site was good according to my evaluators as well. One area that could be improved is citations for the pictures on the site. Users also beleived I could include more credentials. No errors with spelling or grammar were found.</p>

<h3>Recommended/Planned Changes</h3>
<p>Based on the feedback that I have collected, I propose making changes in the following areas:</p>
 <h4>Improving Design and Navigation</h4>
 <ul>
   <li><b>Link Changes: </b>I plan to improve the legibility of my links, by either making the font bold, or changing the color. I want users to comfortably look at my page, and easily find the information they want.</li>
   <li><b>"Home"" Improvement: </b>One user found my "Home" link on the navigation bar hard to find. I plan to either move it to the left, where most "Home" buttons are found, or play with the design to make the "Home" button stand out.</li>
 </ul>

 <h4>Enriching Content</h4>
  <ul>
   <li><b>Expanding "Shops": </b>Evaluators suggested I improve my shops page by including more information. Specifically, users would like to see more dog grooming and pet supplies options.</li>
   <li><b>Cleaning "Events": </b>Two user's noticed that a few links on my "Events" page didn't work, or take the user to the appropriate place. I plan to go in, and clean up the links to improve credibility and accuracy.</li>
 </ul>

 <h4>Enhancing Credibility</h4>
  <ul>
   <li><b>Including Citations: </b>Some users complained that my photographs don't have any citation. Therefore the user is unaware if I have the rights to the photos. I plan to include citations for my photos to reduce any confusion.</li>
   <li><b>Detailed Credentials: </b>One user specifically wanted to see more credentials. She wanted more detail about the designer of the website (me).</li>
  </ul>

 <h4>Revising Code</h4>
 <p>I had two of my evaluators skim my code for any errors or feedback on how I can improve my code. Neither had any ideas to offer me, however, there are a few of my own that I would like to take into consideration to improve my coding.</p>
  <ul>
   <li><b>Legibility: </b>As I go through editing my code, I find I have a hard time reading through it to correct errors. One way to improve this process is to create more indents and spacing to find section and edit them appropriately.</li>
   <li><b>External Links: </b>One area I must improve on is the inclusion of external link targets. I have a hard time remembering to use the target attribute to ensure external pages open in new tabs, rather than taking the user away from my page.</li>
  </ul>

<h3>Reflections on Evaluation Process</h3>
<p>Having my website evaluated so in-depth was a very new experience for me. Actually hoping that my evaluators would find things they didn't like, give me new ideas, or tell me what could be improved on was an extremely interesting experience. I believe I had one reviewer that was a bit too kind, and one who was more critically, and I also had one evaluator that was right in the middle. Each of these three gave me valuable feedback on what I can improve to make my site more user friendly, accurate, and attractive to my users. I was glad to have both younger and older evaluators to get a wider spectrum of feedback. My oldest user isn't the most technologically advanced user, so her feedback was important. The younger users are more familiar with websites and coding, so their feedback was invaluable. Overall, I think I had a good array of evaluators, in both personality, experience with technology, and age. </p>

<p>Overall, my evaluators gave me wonderful insights and suggestions to improve my site. The feedback will enable me to make my site more accurate and user friendly. As was suggested by my evaluators, I plan to include more credentials about myself, as well as my photos, improve the legibility of my links, and correct link errors. I will also be expanding on some information to give users a wider variety of options to choose from. Making these changes should improve my site for my users massively!</p>
